Checking the model before creating elements...
These checks take into account the fact that AutoGEM will
automatically create elements in volumes with material
properties, on surfaces with shell properties, and on curves
with beam section properties.
One or more surfaces have a load but are not part of any elements.One or more surfaces have a load but are not part of any elements.
